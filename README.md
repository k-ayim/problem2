# Problem 2

This Java program calculates the average of elements in an array.

## Instructions

1. Compile the `Problem2AverageCalculator.java` file.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Follow the prompts to input the number of elements in the array and their values.
4. The program will display the average of elements in the array.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the `calculateAverage` method is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because it iterates through the array once to calculate the sum of elements and then performs a constant number of operations to calculate the average.
